# Project-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

## Hello, the R-script run_analysis takes the different txt-files from the UCI HAR Dataset, which are based on result from wearables from different persons, and combines them, so that it can be used for further analysis

## it is crucial to know that you need to install the packages plyr, dplyr as well as data.table. Your working directory has to be the UCI HAR Dataset folder

#### The main result of the script is a dataframe, which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. This will be saved in the variable new_data and also as a text file called tidy_data.txt in your working directory

#### The main result is based on the variable called data, which is the combined dataset from the tabels of the UCI HAR Dataset.

### The single steps that were undertaken are descripted in the script itself.
### Thank you for your time and i hope the script serves you well.
